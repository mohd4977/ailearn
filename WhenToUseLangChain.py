LangChain is the most popular framework for building applications with LLMs.
It provides a set of tools and abstractions to help you build applications that can interact with LLMs, such as chatbots, agents, and more.
Some work or project like RAG can get complex and LangChain can help you to build it faster and easier.
Intricacies of building AI applications without LangChain can take too much time and effort.
LangChain will be going to be a call tool for AI developers.
